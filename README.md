Welcome to the game of JackBlack. A game of BlackJack versus Jack Black.

The taget user is aimed at anyone who enjoys the card game, and is suitable to all ages

The site consists of two pages. The first is a Welcome page, where the user must enter a name to move forward onto the main page, the Blackjack page.
From there, the user can play as many games as they desire, with a prompt asking such a question.

This game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is the second project in a series of five developed for Code Institute. The end goal is a diploma in Full stack development.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the game.

## Design

I originally wanted my design to reside on one page. The idea was also to have the user play the game for a flapjack, as I felt the constant interaction of jack led to the novelty of the game. However this didn't transpire, as I struggled to keep the entire content on one page.

The color of the background closely represents that of a typical casino table. I had originally uploaded an image of an actual casino table, however the image looked distored and stetched over the original design. I opted for this new design for a cleaner look.

## Fonts

For the font, I decided to go for a less-than-formal font and to try and mimmick that seen on a casino table. The fonts chosen were "Londrina Outline" and "Londrina Solid" and I felt the two complemented each other along with the alternating Black and White font colors.
