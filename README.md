Welcome to the game of JackBlack. A game of BlackJack versus Jack Black.

The taget user is aimed at anyone who enjoys the card game, and is suitable to all ages

The site consists of two pages. The first is a Welcome page, where the user must enter a name to move forward onto the main page, the Blackjack page.
From there, the user can play as many games as they desire, with a prompt asking such a question.

This game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is the second project in a series of five developed for Code Institute. The end goal is a diploma in Full stack development.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the game.
